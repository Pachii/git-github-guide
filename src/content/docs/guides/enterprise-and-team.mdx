## 3.1. What is an Organization?
An organization in GitHub is a shared workspace that allows teams to manage multiple projects (repositories) under a single entity. Each member uses their own account to collaborate, while the organization provides centralized control over access, permissions, and project management. Organizations are ideal for companies, open-source communities, and academic groups, enabling structured collaboration with customizable visibility and security settings.
