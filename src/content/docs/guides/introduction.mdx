When software developers want to collaborate on a project, how should they share their work with each other?

In the past, a team of developers might have manually shared files with each other, passing around physical flash drives or sending each other downloads of the newest changes through emails. Imagine you're a developer on a team working on a new feature, only to realize that you were making changes on an outdated version of the code! You may be able to think of many other problems with this rudimentary approach--how will multiple changes be combined between different developers? How can this possibly scale to larger teams? What about security concerns from physical flash drives or unmoderated emails?

Thankfully, these problems have long been solved with **version control**. In this comprehensive guide, you will learn the meaning of version control, as well as the features and functions of the two most popular and essential tools in the professional development world for this task, **Git** and **GitHub**. By the end, you will have the knowledge in order to thrive in a software development environment, whether in a school project, your new internship, or in any other professional setting.

<Aside type="tip" title="Tip">The beginning of this guide is designed to be hands-on, with step-by-step instructions. For the best learning experience, we recommend following along on your own computer as you read. After completing chapter 3, **Repositories**, you can follow chapters 4 and 5 by creating and modifying simple text files.</Aside>

## 1.1. What is Version Control?

**Version control** is broadly defined as the process of keeping track and managing changes in a file. More specifically, **Version Control System**, often abbreviated as **VCS**, refers to software with helpful features that aid developers in managing and tracking changes to files in their projects. Utilizing a version control system, individuals and groups alike can track their progress over time, save different versions of their code, and collaborate with others easily over the internet.

## 1.2. What is Git and GitHub?

**Git** is the industry standard software for **local version control**, which means that it runs directly on your computer. It provides standardized features and functions to enable you, the developer, to organize multiple versions of code and keep a detailed history of changes.

**GitHub** is an **online, cloud-based platform** designed for software development with collaboration. GitHub allows projects to be stored remotely on their cloud servers, not only acting as a backup  but also allowing seamless synchronization and management of the codebase, enabling many developers to work on the same project efficiently.

By using Git with Github, a developer in a team can write and update code on their own computer, recording their own changes with **Git**. Then, once they are ready, they can upload their changes online to **GitHub**, allowing other developers to quickly and seamlessly synchronize the new changes, eliminating the need to worry about being behind and having outdated code.

## 1.3. Who should use GitHub?

GitHub is widely used by software engineers, open-source contributors, and tech teams to collaborate on projects, review code, and manage software development lifecycles. While it's especially beneficial for teams working together on shared codebases, individual developers also leverage GitHub to track their progress, contribute to open-source projects, and showcase their work in professional portfolios. Whether you're a beginner learning to code or an experienced developer managing large-scale applications, GitHub provides essential tools for version control, collaboration, and project management.
