Git is an open-source software serving as the industry standard for version control in software development. In the professional world, it is almost always used in conjunction with GitHub, an online service where large teams can collaborate efficiently on projects. In this comprehensive guide, you will learn the essential commands and functions of Git and GitHub. By the end, you will have the knowledge in order to thrive in a software development environment, whether in a school project or your new internship.

## 1.1. What is Version Control and Git?

If software developers are collaborating on a programming project, how should they share their work with each other? Unfortunately, the answer is not passing around flash drives (even though that would be really funny).

A version control system is software that aids developers by tracking changes to files and directories in repositories, or projects. Utilizing a version control system, individuals and groups alike can track their progress over time, save different versions of their code, and share their code with others easily over the internet.

## 1.2. What is Git?

Git is a free, open-source version control system - the industry standard at that. As expected, it allows users to track and make changes across different branches and easily manage the iteration of the code theyâ€™re working on.

## 1.3. What is GitHub?

GitHub is a powerful online platform designed for software development and collaboration. Built on Git, GitHub enables developers to create, store, manage, and share code efficiently. It serves as a centralized hub where individuals and teams can track changes, work on projects simultaneously, and maintain a structured development workflow.

## 1.4. Who should use GitHub?

GitHub is widely used by software engineers, open-source contributors, and tech teams to collaborate on projects, review code, and manage software development lifecycles. While it's especially beneficial for teams working together on shared codebases, individual developers also leverage GitHub to track their progress, contribute to open-source projects, and showcase their work in professional portfolios. Whether you're a beginner learning to code or an experienced developer managing large-scale applications, GitHub provides essential tools for version control, collaboration, and project management.
