## 5.1. What is a branch?

A branch in Git is an independent line of development that allows multiple versions of a project to exist simultaneously. Branches are useful for developing features, fixing bugs, or experimenting without affecting the main codebase.
By default, Git creates a branch named main (or master in older repositories). Developers create branches to work on separate tasks without interfering with each otherâ€™s progress. Once a branch is complete, it can be merged back into the main branch.

## 5.2. Creating and working in a branch

To create a new branch, use the following command:

```bash frame="none"
git branch <branch-name>
```

This creates a branch but does not switch to it. To move into the new branch, use:

```bash frame="none"
git checkout <branch-name>
```

Alternatively, you can create and switch to a new branch in a single command:

```bash frame="none"
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

After creating a branch, any changes made will be isolated from the main branch until merged.

## 5.3. Merging

Once changes in a branch are complete, they need to be merged into the main branch.

First, switch to the main branch:

```bash frame="none"
git checkout main
```
Then merge the changes from the feature branch:

```bash frame="none"
git merge <branch-name>
```

If conflicts arise, Git will prompt you to resolve them before completing the merge. It should be noted - merge conflicts can get pretty nasty on large scale projects! It is recommended to carefully consider how you divide work among your team.

## 5.4. Pull requests with GitHub
On GitHub, merging is commonly done through a pull request (PR). A PR allows collaborators to review code before merging. To create a pull request:

<Steps>

1. Push the branch to GitHub:

   ```bash frame="none"
   git push -u origin <branch-name>
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository on GitHub and click New Pull Request.
3. Select the branch and compare changes with the main branch.
4. Click Create Pull Request, add a description, and submit for review.

</Steps>

Once approved, the PR can be merged into the main branch through the GitHub interface.


## 5.5. Advanced branch tools

```bash frame="none"
git branch -d <branch-name> 
```

Deletes a branch after merging.

```bash frame="none"
git branch -D <branch-name>
```

Forces deletion of a branch, even if it has unmerged changes.

```bash frame="none"
git rebase <branch-name>
```

Reapplies commits from one branch onto another, ensuring a linear commit history.
