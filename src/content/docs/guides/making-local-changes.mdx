With your local repository set up and linked to your remote repository, it's time to start coding! This section will walk you through some of the most important Git commands, so it's crucial that you understand them.

## 4.1. Viewing and Adding Changes

Once you've done some work, whether it's adding, modifying, or deleting any file(s), you'll have to **stage your changes**. Think of staging as isolating the files you want to manage.

To check which files have been modified and their staged status, use:

```bash frame="none"
git status
```
Before committing, changes need to be staged with the add command. To stage a specific file, run:
```bash frame="none"
git add <file-name>
```

To stage all modified files (added, changed, and deleted):
```bash frame="none"
git add -A
```

## 4.2. Committing Changes

A commit is a snapshot of all staged changes. To commit, use:

```bash frame="none"
git commit -m "Descriptive message about changes"
```

<Aside type="tip" title="Helpful Analogy">
You can think of **staging changes** as packing a box with related items (files), and **committing changes** as sealing up the box and labeling it so you and others know what's inside.

## 4.3. Pushing Changes

Once you have made and committed changes, push them to the remote repository:

```bash frame="none"
git push origin <branch-name>
```

This updates the remote repository with your latest commits.

## 4.4. Pulling Changes

To ensure your local branch is up to date with the remote repository before making further changes, use:

```bash frame="none"
git pull origin <branch-name>
```

This fetches and merges remote updates into your branch, helping prevent conflicts.

Now that weâ€™ve learned how to make a local repository and make changes, this diagram can be very helpful in visualizing these commands and how different developers can track their own changes to code in relation to the changes their collaborators made. Note: "fetch" is something we have not touched on but is run automatically as part of the `git pull` command. 

## 4.5. Undoing Changes

```bash frame="none"
git checkout -- <file-name>
```
Reverts changes in a file.

```bash frame="none"
git reset HEAD <file-name>
```
Unstages a file from a commit.

```bash frame="none"
git revert <commit-hash>
```
Creates a new commit that undoes changes from a specific commit.
