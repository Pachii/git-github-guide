## 3.1. What is a repository?
A repository (or “repo”) is a storage space on GitHub where developers manage their code, project files, and version history. It tracks all changes, allowing collaboration, branching, and rollback to previous versions.

## 3.2. Ownership and Privacy
A repository can be owned individually, or by multiple collaborators. Collaborators will have to invite you to their repositories via email.

You can view pending invites to repositories under the notifications tab in the top right.

When you create a repository, you can choose to make it either public or private. This can be easily changed within repository settings after the matter.

If you're showing off work to employers, you can grant them access to a private repository with a key.

## 3.3. Creating a Repository
On the upper right hand corner of the navigation bar, click the + button and select New Repository.

It should direct you to a page labeled Create a new repository.

Here, you can name your repository and select privacy permissions. You will also have the option to include a README file, which is just a file included in many project repositories. It typically provides essential information about a project, including its purpose, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and any dependencies. 

## 3.4. Cloning a Repository
Because the repository we just created is a “remote” repository (meaning it exists on a server/online), we need a way to work on our project locally, on our own computer! 

On GitHub, navigate to the main page of your repository. Above the list of your files, click the < > Code button.

Copy the URL for the repository. 

You'll see there are 3 different options to copy the URL:

- **HTTPS** is used when copying the repository in your terminal using Git commands, which is what this guide will be focusing on. 

- **SSH** is used if you have a certificate issued by your organization, and is typically used in professional, enterprise settings. 

- **GitHub CLI** is used if you are cloning your repository in your terminal using GitHub CLI. 

Once you have your HTTPS link copied to your clipboard, navigate to your terminal. Enter the directory in which you want to store your project’s git file. 

Enter the following command. This will be the same for Mac/Windows/Linux.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/.../....git
```

Press enter, and you should see the following result.

Congratulations, you’ve just cloned your first repository!
