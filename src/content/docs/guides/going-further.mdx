While many of the commands you may find may be niche for your specific needs, Git commands can greatly increase your version control efficiency. 

To clarify, these commands are not essential for use of Git - learning and mastering every Git command out is likely a waste of time. To find a specific command, it is recommended to simply search online for your desired use case. Tech forums like Stackoverflow often contain suggestions for certain Git commands - once you locate one that sounds useful, you should refer to the documentation.
